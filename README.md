# Angular-udemy-tutorial-2

This is a Udemy project that I completed while training from an Angular project in my current role. While I did use a tutorial to help create it, I completed most steps independently before seeing the instructor's solution. In addition, I added some additional features to the app and fixed some bugs with the functionality.
